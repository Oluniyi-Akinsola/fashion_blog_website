# Fashion Blog Website
Fikky is a budding fashion blogger, and has asked me to build a new website for him, just in time for New York Fashion Week.
I am using my HTML knowledge to create the underlying structure of the blog.
This will include plenty of pictures, links, lists, and other HTML elements.
